Medium Priority - Occasionally Asked
These are less frequent but still might appear in technical coding tests.

18.Perfect number (Q4) - Number theory, not common but useful.
19.Wildcard matching in strings (Q8, Q48) - Regex and string pattern matching.
20.Replace a substring in a string (Q13, Q34) - Common string manipulation problem.
21.Heap sort (Q14) - More advanced sorting but less common.
22.Rank elements of an array (Q15) - Good for algorithmic problem-solving.
23.Longest palindrome in an array (Q18) - Combines palindrome checks with arrays.
24.Armstrong number (Q20) - Number manipulation.
25.Automorphic number (Q27) - Number theory, less relevant for frontend.
26.Remove all characters from a string except alphabets (Q29) - Regex or string manipulation.

Low Priority - Rarely Asked
These questions are rare in frontend interviews but may still pop up for more backend or algorithmic coding interviews.

27.Add two matrices (Q22) - Matrix operations are uncommon in frontend.
28.Sum of natural numbers using recursion (Q21, Q23) - Recursion, but less practical in frontend.
29.Find the smallest element in an array (Q30) - Simple, but sorting might be more challenging.
30.Reverse the elements of an array (Q31) - Usually combined with sorting or palindrome questions.
31.Remove space from a string (Q35) - Regular expression use, simple.
32.Count inversions in an array (Q36) - Advanced algorithm, less likely in frontend.
33.Find the largest consecutive subsequence (Q37) - More advanced algorithmic thinking.
